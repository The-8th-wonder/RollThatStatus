## What is it?  

RollThatStatus is a website that displays a random discord status, along with features to;  

- Re-roll the main displayed discord status
- A tab for showing a showcased "Stats of the Day"
- An announcements drop down that is only available when the creator(me) has an announcement to share
  - Announcements can be things like wishing everyone a happy holiday!
- A button that shows a list of all the available main statuses that can be rolled
- A secret button that displays a mystery text box or image
- With the possibility of more to come! (no promises though)  

You can check out the website [here](https://roll-that-status.vercel.app)!

## What inspired me to create this?  

I use discord every day, and have used it for many years.  
A feature discord has, is you can add a *custom status* to your profile, which looks like this:  

![alt text](/roll-that-status/src/imgs/status-example-readm.png)  
[image source](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035407531-Custom-Status)  

I noticed, as I used discord, that I would change my custom status often. Sometimes, multiple times a day.  
I had a set list of status that I really liked and rotated through, and would also change them depending on the day.  
Eventually, I got tired of constantly changing my status or not knowing what to change it to, especially since I had a select few that I knew I liked.  

So, my solution was to create a website with all the discord statuses I use, and just have the website link as my permanent status (which is what my discord status is now!).  

Originally, when I first made the website, it was just the main status and nothing else.  
But, as I continued to work on it, I came up with more and more ideas, and the scope has creeped from there!.  

The project is entirely a personal project that I work on for fun in my free time.  
I also have custom created quite a few of the images/buttons/backgrounds.  
The entire theme of this website is a gambling/casino aesthetic because I thought it would be fun and I really like that aesthetic.  

Yes, the main background of the entire website I made myself, and yes it looks like that on purpose.  
I originally made that background as a template of what I wanted it to be, but thinking about it further, I thought it would be way funnier to just make that the actually background, so that's what it is.  

I'm not sure how long I will work on this, but I do update the "Status of the Day" fairly often, and will update the announcements when I have an announcement of some kind.  
I also might start adding more to the secret button I have, along with any ideas I might come up with in the future.  
Make sure to check back in and stay tuned for updates!

## What did I use to make this?  

This entire project I did using the React library, and Vercel to deploy the website.  

Below is a list of everything I've used, along with a small description on what it was used for.  
I will try to update the list regularly whenever there are changes.  

- Visual Studio Code
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- [React Library](https://react.dev) ~ JavaScript library for front end development
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) ~ a website that lets you deploy your websites for free
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) ~ CSS framework for managing website sizing to display size (i.e., handling different desktop screen sizes and mobile size)
